several auxiliary functions for RSA cryptosystem
Below you'll find several auxiliary functions for RSA cryptosystem, and an implementation of the RSA encryption and decryption functions. Recall, that the textbook RSA Encryption function takes a message  𝑚 , a modulus  𝑁 , and an encryption (public) exponent  𝑒 , and returns  𝑚𝑒mod𝑁 . The decryption function then takes a ciphertext  𝑐 , a modulus  𝑁 , and a decryption (secret) exponent  𝑑 , and returns  𝑐𝑑mod𝑁 .
